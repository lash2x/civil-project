	<li>the imigration system is out dated and needs reformation</li>
	<li>According to figures drawn from the U.S. Census Bureau, there were roughly 45 million immigrants in the United States in 2017, meaning that immigrants make up about 14 percent of the population. Nearly 90 million people—28 percent of the overall U.S. population—are immigrants or their U.S.-born children, according to the 2018 Current Population Survey.</li>
	<li>The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 was a sweeping act that ended the national origins quota system—which disproportionately favored European immigrants—and created the foundation of the current system, under which immigration is based around family reunification and the needs of employers.</li>
	<li>The Refugee Act of 1980 adopted the United Nation’s definition of “refugees” and expanded the annual admission of refugees. </li>

	<li>In 1986, a Democratic Congress approved, and President Reagan signed into law, a major immigration reform bill, which created a path to citizenship for people who entered the United States without permission before 1982. The law also made it illegal for employers to knowingly hire undocumented workers.</li>
	<li>In 1990, President George H.W. Bush signed into law legislation that created the Temporary Protected Status program, which allowed people fleeing violence and natural disasters to legally work and live in the United States until their home country had sufficiently recovered.</li>
	<li>There need to be more specific bills and laws passed to help immigrants. the ones currently do not cover many imigrants in certain situations.</li>
